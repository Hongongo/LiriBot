# LIRI Bot

## How does it works?

LIRI Bot is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## How can I use it?

You need to execute the following command on your CLI 
* node liri.js + [YOUR COMMAND] [SERCH VALUE]:

Command | Search Value
------------ | -------------
concert-this | artist/concert name
spotify-this-song | your song name
movie-this | your movie name
do-what-it-says |
